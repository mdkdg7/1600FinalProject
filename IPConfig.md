# So, what even is IPConfig?
IPConfig will let you see all your current TCP/IP network values, such as your IPv4, IPv6, subnet mask, and defualt gateway.
There are also some parameters you can use with IPConfig to get more results.
So, now that we are in the command prompt, we can simply type "ipconfig" and press enter.
