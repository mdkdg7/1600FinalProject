# As well as the basic ipconfig and ipconfig/all command, there are other parameters you can include as well.
One parameter is "ipconfig /displaydns"
This will show the DNS client resolver cache, which can be used to hold recently obtained records by the computer.
Here is an example:

Another is "ipconfig /flushdns"
This parameter will reset the DNS client cache.

The final parameter I am going to show, although there are many more, is the "ipconfig /?" parameter.
This will display help for the user.
